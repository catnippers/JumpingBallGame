# Jumping Ball
## Author: Tomasz Buga

This is project I've made for the recruitment process for the PlayWay School's Unity Beginners Course. 
I think I overkilled it, because the task was to create simple light switch in 3D... and they didn't response, as they probably took it as showoff, instead of me underestimating my skills. 

Nevertheless I really like the outcome, so I thought I will keep working on it.

Project uses Unity's Standard Assets for Ball model and Material prefabs. 
If you want to run this project, you'd have to import Standard Assets from Package Manager and then import them to the Assets/Plugins/ folder.

Soundtrack is my production available @ https://www.beatstars.com/beat/good-old-days-4665863
